# Tools Used in Image Processing:

#Image Filtering:
Techniques like Median Filter or Gaussian Filter can be used for noise reduction and smoothing in CT images.

#Image Segmentation:
Methods such as Thresholding or Clustering can segment the liver and tumor regions from the CT scans.

#Image Edge Detection:
Edge detection algorithms like Sobel Operator or Canny Edge Detector can help in identifying boundaries of tumors or organs in the images.

#Image Enhancement:
Techniques like Anisotropic Diffusion Filters can enhance the contrast and details of CT images, making tumors more distinguishable.

#Image Processing (Upsampling/Downsampling):
Methods like Bilinear or Bicubic Interpolation can resize images without losing quality, which can be useful for preprocessing or analysis.

#User Interface:
Libraries like Tkinter can be used to create a user-friendly interface for displaying and interacting with processed images and results.
Technology and Process Overview:

#CT Image Processing:
Utilize CT scans from datasets like the Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset on Kaggle for training and testing the image processing algorithms.
Enhance images using Anisotropic Diffusion Filters to improve clarity and detectability of tumors.
Segment liver and tumor regions using morphological operations (dilation and erosion) to isolate cancerous areas.

#Detection Techniques:
Apply image segmentation methods to highlight tumor regions based on predefined characteristics like intensity thresholds or clustering patterns.
Implement edge detection algorithms to detect boundaries between tumors and healthy tissues, aiding in precise tumor localization.

#Additional Features (Future Scope):
Consider implementing features like image compression, watermark removal, restoration, and further enhancement to expand the project's capabilities.
